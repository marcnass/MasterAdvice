## Study Plan for Robotics <a name="StudyPlan"></a>
The Robotics Master's has 120 credits, including 2 (or 3) 10-credit Semester Projects, an uncredited internship and a 30-credit Master's Project (which can be done in a lab at EPFL, in industry or in a lab in a university other than EPFL).

- MA1: 26 credits.
- MA2: 27 credits, including a semester project (10 credits).
- Internship: 3 months during the summer (end of June till end of September).
- MA3: 26 credits, including a semester project (10 credits).
- MA4: 20 credits (started out at 26, dropped a 6 credit course in week 10).
- MA5: 30 credits master thesis, TBD.

## My Courses <a name="Courses"></a>
My interests lie in signal processing, image processing and mathematics (analysis and probability/stochastic calculus mostly). There are also some flavors of optimization and information theory that I definitely liked as well. The original plan was to take courses in control, image/signal processing and maths, but I ended up discarding the idea of wanting to do control in favor of my other interests.

I started my master's in the autumn 2022 semester, it is possible that some courses have seen a name change / content change since then.

Before detailing each course, here is how I divided them into my 4 course semesters:
- MA1: Stochastic Models for Communications (minor), Applied ML, Basics of Mobile Robotics, Model Predictive control, SHS I, Image Processing I, ML Programming.
- MA2: Principles of Digital Communications (minor), SHS II, Robotics Practicals, Robotics Project I, Image Processing II, System Identification.
- MA3: Information Theory and Coding (minor), Basics of Robotics for Manipulation, Robotics Project II, Convex Optimization.
- MA4: Advanced Probability and Applications (minor), Statistical Signal and Data Processing through Applications (minor), Advanced Computer Graphics (minor, later dropped), Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition.

I wanted to finish Image Processing I and II as early as I could to quickly "unlock" the knowledge to be able to use it for projects, as I knew this is where my main interests were. Other than that, the order of courses was dictated by how important they were to me and whether they constituted any prerequisites. For example, taking Stochastic Models in my MA1 proved to be a smart move, as it helped me in many of my future courses. Similarly, for Applied ML, being familiar with some ML concepts from the beginning was useful, as ML appears kind of everywhere now.


### Core Courses <a name="Core"></a>
Fair workload = workload in accordance with the number of credits.

| Course         | Credits | Workload | Difficulty | Comments |
|----------------|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [Applied Machine Learning](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/applied-machine-learning-MICRO-455) | 4       | Fair    | Hard                   | I did not like this course. It presents a catalogue of well known ML concepts with not too much maths (=> not a good theoretical ML course), no code (=> not a good practical ML course), and some intuition (=> you at least learn something). It is a useful course in the sense that, later on in my studies, I did not get lost when ML concepts got mentioned and I knew where to start looking if I wanted details on a specific concept. I did not learn much from the exercise sheets, and the final exam is vicious (MCQs with multiple answers and negative points, with no past exams to practice and very little resemblance with the exercise sheets). |
| [Basics of Mobile Robotics](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/basics-of-mobile-robotics-MICRO-452)    | 4       | Fair/Heavy    | Medium       | This course is one big catalogue of concepts in mobile robotics, do not expect the lectures to go into any details. It is accompanied by exercises, a graded project, and a final exam. It's a Mondada course, this professor prefers rigor and correctness over fanciness (keep that in mind for the project). The project (to be done in groups of 4) is not super fun in my opinion, but at least allows you to get hands-on experience in some sub-domain of mobile robotics. The final exam is a mess: it's a MCQ where you need to motivate your answers. The prof will tell you that a wrong answer that has been well motivated will be counted correct, but I've found this description to be very subjective. It is however very similar to the case studies done in the lectures, so definitely do attend them. This course is also a double-edged sword: should it be taken in MA1, where we risk not understanding many concepts, but we are at least made aware of them early on (=> we can use them later), or should we take this course in MA3 when we've had time to take courses/projects that make us familiar with more of these concepts, easing our understanding of them and our use of them in the project, but preventing us from having an overview of mobile robotics basics early on ? |
| [Basics of Robotics for Manipulation](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/basics-of-robotics-for-manipulation-MICRO-450)    | 3       | Light    | Easy    | Very disorganized course, but still teaches useful content. The slides can sometimes be difficult to understand. The grade is based solely on a final exam, studying for it consists of properly understanding the exercise sheets and training on past exams. The professor however is very nice and is always ready to answer questions and provide explanations.  |
| [Model Predictive Control](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/model-predictive-control-ME-425)   | 4       | Fair    | Hard                 | These 4 credits are difficult but very interesting. They require a solid background in control (especially state space), but surprisingly not a background in optimization, as the necessary concepts are taught at the beginning of the course (having done optimization beforehand or in parallel is definitely going to help though). The theory is incredible, but difficult to grasp, and there are unfortunately no given exercises to help practice it, which is problematic as the final exam is fully theoretical. The weekly exercises consist of solving problems in Matlab. Fortunately, a big chunk of the grade is dedicated to a project, which in general consists of developing a MPC controller for some simulated device (a drone, a rocket, ...). The project is quite fun, and not too difficult if the Matlab exercises were done and understood beforehand. The course is very well organized, the professor is great, the TAs are very helpful. |
| [Robotics Practicals](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/robotics-practicals-MICRO-453)   | 2       | Fair    | Fair                      | A course worth its 2 credits, the experience you get from it highly depends on which "menu" of practicals you end up with. The variance on the difficulty and length of the practicals is very big. |
| **SHS**: [Experimental History of Science I](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/programme-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/coursebook/experimental-history-of-science-i-HUM-402) and [II](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/programme-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/coursebook/experimental-history-of-science-ii-HUM-466) | 6 = 2*3 | Fair| Fall semester is fair, spring semester is project-dependent |  Very interesting humanities course, where you get to learn about science from a historical point of view, and experimental techniques used by scientists in the past. The project is incredible: you get to choose some scientific experiment, reenact it, and study it from a historical/social/experimental point of view. For example, we built a Foucault pendulum and reenacted the initial exposition Foucault conducted in the 19th century, and studied it from a social point of view. The difficulties of the project highly depend on its nature. |


### Options <a name="Options"></a>
At the time of writing, 17 credits in a specialization (industrial, medical, mobile) need to be taken. I chose the medical robotics specialization.

| Course         | Credits | Workload | Difficulty | Comments | Recommend |
|----------------|---------|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| [Image Processing I](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/image-processing-i-MICRO-511) | 3      | Fair/Light    | Easy                 | Similar to classical signals & systems courses, but in 2D with applications to image processing. The theory is not difficult to understand if you're familiar with basic signal processing tools, and the labs that accompany the theory are interesting, useful and not difficult. The course is very well organized, and knows how to make 3 credits worth taking. | Yes! |
| [Image Processing II](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/image-processing-ii-MICRO-512) | 3       | Fair    | Medium/Hard              | The sequel to Image Processing I, similar in terms of organization. This time however, the course presents more advanced concepts that I found to be VERY interesting but also much more difficult to grasp than those taught in Image Processing I. It requires being at ease with basic math concepts (analysis, linear algebra) and signal processing (or equivalently, what was taught in IP1). One of my favorite courses.  | Yes, if you want to delve further into image processing |
| [Convex Optimization](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/convex-optimization-MGT-418) | 5       | Fair    | Medium/Hard              | An excellent course in all of its aspects (content and organization). I had a lot of fun learning the concepts this course teaches, which turned out to be useful for me. It is not a purely theoretical course, the professor motivates every concept with concrete examples, and we are able to apply them in short programming exercises as well as small graded mini-projects. It is not an easy course though, the exercises need to be done correctly to master the theory behind the concepts, as the midterm and final do not contain any code-writing, only maths. Also one of my favorite courses. It also serves as an unofficial prerequisite for many courses, as optimization really does pop up everywhere.  | Yes! |
| [Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/image-analysis-and-pattern-recognition-EE-451) | 4 | Fair/Light    | Fair  | A very good course which is very application and code oriented. The theory is light, the learning happens when doing the labs and the project. It is an excellent course to take if you are looking for practical experience in image processing, be it in classical techniques or newer ML-based techniques.   | Yes |
| [Machine Learning Programming](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/machine-learning-programming-MICRO-401) | 2       | Fair    | Fair            | I took this course to get some practice alongside the Applied ML course which did not contain any, and I was disappointed. This course consists of implementing (in Matlab...) some basic ML algorithms such as PCA, kNN, etc, without necessarily using them to do anything. On the bright side, having to implement these algorithms forced me to understand them well (=> it helped me grasp the material taught in Applied ML), and having to implement them in Matlab made me better at using it, but I expected actual applications of these ML tools to concrete problems, and I did not get any.   | No, unless you want an excuse to get good at Matlab |
| [System Identification](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/master/robotique/coursebook/system-identification-ME-421) | 3       | Fair    | Doable                 | Very standard course, not too difficult in terms of theory or practice. System identification techniques are presented in the lectures, and are implemented (in Matlab) in computer exercises. The final and computer exercises are not too difficult, but cannot be improvised, they require a good understanding of the theory. | Yes |

### Minor <a name="Minor"></a>
I took a minor in Communication Systems. I originally wanted to do a minor in Mathematics, but the course plan I had laid out was too messy. I preferred using the semester projects as opportunities to learn the maths I wanted to learn, and to instead focus on signal processing (and later on probabilities and information theory) in a Communications Systems minor.

| Course         | Credits | Workload | Difficulty | Comments | Recommend |
|----------------|---------|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| [Stochastic Models for Communications](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/mineur/mineur-en-systemes-de-communication/coursebook/modeles-stochastiques-pour-les-communications-COM-300) | 6       | Fair    | Hard                         | Course **taught in French** mainly to 3rd year bachelor students in communication systems. It's a maths course (not proof heavy though) taught on blackboard by an excellent professor (prof. Patrick Thiran at the time of writing). The content is very useful pretty much everywhere in signal processing and control. The exercises are hard, the two midterms and final take a lot of time to study for, but overall one of my favorite courses. It is also very well organized. | Yes, if you will be doing any form of signal processing, data science or control  |
| [Principles of Digital Communications](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/mineur/mineur-en-systemes-de-communication/coursebook/principles-of-digital-communications-COM-302) | 6       | Fair/Heavy    | Hard                   | One of the hardest 6 credit courses I ever took, also taught to 3rd year bachelor students in communication systems. It is also taught on blackboard by an EXCELLENT professor (prof. Emre Telatar at the time of writing). The content is difficult to understand and master, and requires a good grasp of basic math tools (analysis, linear algebra), a very good grasp of probability, a good grasp of basic stochastic calculus (the content taught in Stochastic Models), and a good grasp of signal processing. The midterm and final are difficult, the project is difficult but very interesting. The course as a whole has extremely interesting content, and leans on the theoretical side which for me is a big plus. The course organization is interesting, as the professor shows up and teaches whatever is on his mind, and it somehow works out. Other aspects (exercises, midterm, project, final) are very well organized though. | Yes, if the topic interests you  |
| [Information Theory and Coding](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/mineur/mineur-en-systemes-de-communication/coursebook/information-theory-and-coding-COM-404) | 8       | Fair    | Very Hard                           | Theoretical course taught on blackboard by (at the time of writing) prof. Telatar, so once again excellent in terms of quality, but also very difficult. It also requires a good grasp of basic maths and probability, but also requires some creativity for problem solving. The concepts are extremely interesting (albeit some of them are kind of niche from my point of view) but also very difficult to grasp. I struggled a lot with the intuition behind some concepts, and also struggled with the maths. I wanted an introduction to information theory and coding when I took this course, and I got what I wanted. It even made me rethink my main interests, as I find this domain to be very rich and extremely interesting. Course organization is similar to Principles of Digital Communications but even wilder, asking a simple question can derail the lecture. This is not a bad thing, as it makes every lecture unique. Other aspects (exercises, midterm, final) are very well organized though. | Yes, if the topic interests you (you get to be taught by an expert in the field who's been a professor since before you were born probably)  |
| [Advanced Probability and Applications](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/advanced-probability-and-applications-COM-417) | 8       | Fair    | Hard                        | Yet another theoretical course taught on blackboard. I took it because I wanted to (re)learn basic probability concepts from a measure-theoretical point of view, to learn about martingales and to get better at probability in general. It is one of my favorite courses in terms of content, I very much enjoyed everything I learned. It is a maths course though, so some creativity is required for problem solving, which (on top of understanding the concepts taught) is not necessarily easy to acquire. The course is very well organized in all of its aspects. | Yes, if the topic interests you |
| [Statistical Signal and Data Processing Through Applications](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/mineur/mineur-en-systemes-de-communication/coursebook/statistical-signal-and-data-processing-through-applications-COM-500) | 8 | Fair/Light| Doable    | As the name indicates, this course aims at teaching signal and data processing tools via applications. The professor teaching this course is very application oriented, and will put the emphasis on that throughout the semester. This course is an excellent complement to the theoretical signal processing courses I took, as I was able to code a lot of things throughout the semester, and not just do maths.  | Yes, if you want a hands-on signal processing course  |
| [Advanced Computer Graphics](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/fr/mineur/mineur-en-systemes-de-communication/coursebook/advanced-computer-graphics-CS-440) | 6       | VERY Heavy    | Very Hard                        | An extremely rich course, but VERY time consuming in the way it aims at teaching physical-based rendering. It is clearly worth more than 6 credits (even according to the professor teaching it!). The semester starts with 4 labs, where you're asked to gradually implement basic features of a renderer. Every lab is very time consuming, some are more fun than others, but each one is a good learning experience. The semester then continues with a project (which can be started in week 9), where you can implement and validate as many features as you want to produce a nice looking render based on a theme (see [here](https://rgl.epfl.ch/pages/courses/cs440/sp23/competition2023) for examples). It is at this stage (week 10) that I dropped this course (even after having gotten near-perfect grades on all the labs), as the bare minimum required to get a 4/6 on the project is difficult to achieve and time consuming. The course philosophy is very application oriented, the professor would give a lecture on some topic, and you are left on your own for its implementation for the labs or project. The theory this course teaches is not difficult, but the practical (C++ programming) aspect, as fun as it is, is difficult to get done correctly, and is the main part of this course. | Yes, if you like coding in C++ and producing cool renders :)  |


## My Projects <a name="Projects"></a>

### Semester Project 1

I did my first Semester Project at the [Biomedical Imaging Group](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/), with Prof. Unser, supervised by Dr. Rahul Parhi (Dr at the time, now Prof). It was a project on approximation theory with exponential splines.

- The goal of the project was to derive an approximation rate of a certain class of functions using exponential splines (= piecewise polynomial/exponential functions).
- The work was purely theoretical, I spent a semester doing proofs. I liked it very much.
- The lab is great, the supervision quality is good.
- The professor has strict expectations, not producing work is not acceptable.
- I wanted a reason to get better at functional analysis and measure theory, and this project was it. I also got to read my first papers, and to start uncovering somewhat recent image processing research. It was my first experience with "research" as a whole.

### Semester Project 2

I did my second Semester Project at the [AudioVisual Communications Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/), with Dr. Fageot, my TA was Dr. Guillemet. It was a project on multivariate Hawkes processes for sparse estimation of neural network intensities.

- The first goal of the project was to setup a mathematical model (based on Hawkes processes) for the activity of neurons.
- The second goal was to adapt a known sparsity-promoting optimization algorithm to estimate these intensities based on data (I had access to spike recordings in turtle brains), and implement it.
- The work for the first half of the project was theoretical (getting familiar with the mathematical tools in both probability and optimization), then it shifted into implementation of the optimization algorithm and testing it on available data. 
- The lab is great, the supervision quality is good.
- I wanted a reason to do more "scientific" programming, more probabilities and more optimization, and this project was it. After my first theoretical project, I wanted something a little more concrete.


## My Internships <a name="Internships"></a>
I did my internship at [Kandou Bus](https://kandou.com/), in their Lausanne office (at the innovation park). It was a summer internship that lasted 3 months from the end of June 2023 to the end of September 2023. This internship was published on the is-academia portal for the IC and EL sections (it was therefore not visible for MT/RO students!), and it was a friend in EL that told me about it. I applied by emailing HR then passing 3 interviews (2 technical, 1 with HR). The moral of the story is that interesting internships are not limited to what is made visible to you on is-academia, do check what your friends in other sections can see.

I spent 3 months working on the modeling of wireline links (= writing Python code to be able to simulate communication pipelines) in the Advanced R&D team. The atmosphere was great, everyone around me had excellent technical and pedagogical skills, and the project I was given was interesting. I got to apply and refine knowledge from signal processing and digital communications.

## Other Activities <a name="Other"></a>
I spent some time before every fall semester working on [S4S](https://students4students.ch/). Each semester contained 3 courses which I TA'd (a selection from analysis I, analysis II, linear algebra, signals & systems for MT/SV, image processing II, principles of digital communications). I was class representative for the duration of my masters, and I spent my MA3/MA4 at [Agepoly](https://agepoly.ch/), in the representation team.

Overall I'd say that the above did take some time, but considering that I did not fill up my semesters with tons of credits, it was manageable. I also gave myself a lot of time for personal hobbies/activities.
